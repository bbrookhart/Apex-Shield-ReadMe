# 🛡️ Apex Shield: Project Aegis

> **"The ultimate defense for the next generation of intelligence."**

Apex Shield is an advanced security framework designed to harden Large Language Models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks, prompt injections, and data leakage. This system acts as armor for safe, secure, and ethical AI deployments, ensuring intelligence remains powerful but never compromised.

## 🧑🏼‍🔬 Key Features (The Power Suite)

**Sentinel Guardrails:** Real-time santization of incoming prompts to prevent "jailbreaking."

**The Vault (PII Masking):** Automatically detects and redacts Personally Identifiable Information before it reaches the model.

**Aegis Protocol:** A hardened "Internal Monologue" system that prevents the AI from leaking its system instructions.

**Threat Perception:** An observability dashboard that flags suspicious patterns and "villainous" intent.

## 🚀 Deployment 

To summon the shield, install the package via your terminal

```bash
pip install apex-shield
